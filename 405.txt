No, that is not the reason they exist. Every DM actually contains its DMKSP, DMSNES, and DMTS so at any point in time a DM can actually have only one DMXXX. We had arguments over sharing DM with multiple solvers but I think that is a goofy optimization.    Hmm, since PC/KSP/SNES/TS know about DM why don't we just stick that information in the solver. Seems simpler, there must be some reason.
