The number of messages during the MatAssembly is effectively halved MatAssemblyEnd         2 1.0 7.2139e+01 1.0 0.00e+00 0.0 2.6e+06 1.9e+04 1.8e+01 62  0 99  8 15  62  0 99  8 15     0 But that was only a few second faster (and this may even only be system noise). I’ll see what I can infer from the openspeedshop profiling, and might give another MPI implementation a try during the weekend (I’m using BullxMPI, based on an ancient OpenMPI, but maybe IntelMPI gives better results).  Thanks anyway!
