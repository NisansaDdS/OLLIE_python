As I said the extra space is 64 bit. Now if you want 128 bit alignment we could put a 128 bit.    What alignment boundaries are useful for Intel processes? 64 yup, 128, 256, 512 ? Does higher values provide better performance for SIMD etc?     Hmm, Hong, how come we don't use this? I didn't realize it worked this way. This would shut Jed up immediately.  Sadly, I fear the answer is we don't use memkind because it sucks :-) Calm down Jeff, I didn't insult your mother.    Barry
