No, that is not the reason they exist.

Every DM actually contains its DMKSP, DMSNES, and DMTS so at any point in time a DM can actually have only one DMXXX.

We had arguments over sharing DM with multiple solvers but I think that is a goofy optimization.
0.716: (We; had; arguments)
0.447: (DM; be sharing with; multiple solvers)

Hmm, since PC/KSP/SNES/TS know about DM why don't we just stick that information in the solver.
0.708: (that information; do n't we just stick in; the solver)
0.683: (we; do n't we just stick that information in; the solver)
0.631: (Hmm; know about; DM)
0.629: (we; do n't we just stick; that information)
0.462: (PC/KSP/SNES/TS; know about; DM)

Seems simpler, there must be some reason.
